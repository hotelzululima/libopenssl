This project repackages the OpenBSD fork of OpenSSL so it is buildable with
autotools.

The idea is to make OpenSSL builds and the OpenSSL fork in particular easier to
test, hack on and contribute to for those used to autotools. It also
reorganizes the source tree somewhat so that it is arranged like many other
projects.
